What is your assessment of the assignment? Was it helpful? Was it fun?

It was kind of fun to code in assembly but in the end I felt it was more
tedious than fun because it was so easy to mess up and it would take a
long time to look for the errors.

(optional) What information can you provide about your submission that
will help your grader to grade it in the most favorable light? In
particular, what bugs are in your submission?

None known bugs.
