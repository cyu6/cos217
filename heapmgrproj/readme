authorized sources should be included here. Please note that using an
unauthorized source may trigger a course penalty, and depending on the
nature of the interaction, may additionally require the interaction
being reported to the Committee on Discipline. Write "None" if you used
no unauthorized sources of information.

Student 1: What is your assessment of the assignment? Was it helpful?
Was it fun?

The assignment solidified my under the hood understanding, I really
liked it!

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Student 2: What is your assessment of the assignment? Was it helpful?
Was it fun?

I thought the assignment was helpful in reinforcing concepts about
testing, debugging, and memory management. Overall about average in
terms of fun.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
(optional) What information can you provide about your submission that
will help your grader to grade it in the most favorable light? In
particular, what bugs are in your submission?



------------------------------------------------------------------------
What warnings does splint generate on
testheapmgr.c/heapmgr4.c/checker4.c/chunk4.c, and what are your
disagreements with them? Copy the splint warnings here, and express your
disagreement after each warning. If there are no warnings, then write
"None."

None

------------------------------------------------------------------------
What warnings does critTer generate on checker4.c, and what are your
disagreements with them? Copy the critTer warnings here, and express
your disagreement after each warning. If there are no warnings, then
write "None."

None

------------------------------------------------------------------------
What warnings does critTer generate on heapmgr4.c, and what are your
disagreements with them? Copy the critTer warnings here, and express
your disagreement after each warning. If there are no warnings, then
write "None."

None

------------------------------------------------------------------------
What warnings does splint generate on
testheapmgr.c/heapmgr5.c/checker5.c/chunk5.c, and what are your
disagreements with them? Copy the splint warnings here, and express your
disagreement after each warning. If there are no warnings, then write
"None."

None

------------------------------------------------------------------------
What warnings does critTer generate on checker5.c, and what are your
disagreements with them? Copy the critTer warnings here, and express
your disagreement after each warning. If there are no warnings, then
write "None."

   checker5.c: line 58: low priority:
      A loop should consist of fewer than 35 lines;
         this loop consists of 99 lines; consider refactoring

   checker5.c: line 110: low priority:
      A loop should consist of fewer than 35 lines;
         this loop consists of 47 lines; consider refactoring

   checker5.c: line 19: low priority:
      A function should consist of fewer than 140 lines;
         this function consists of 168 lines; consider refactoring

We disagree with these warnings because we believe the function
Checker_isValid() is clearer as one single function with one long
loop that will traverse every bin in the data structure. The majority
of the tests require traversal of the doubly linked lists in the bins,
so it makes the most sense to have just one loop per traversal.

What warnings does critTer generate on heapmgr5.c, and what are your
disagreements with them? Copy the critTer warnings here, and express
your disagreement after each warning. If there are no warnings, then
write "None."

What are the CPU times and heap memory consumed by testheapmgr using
heapmgr1.c, heapmgr2.c, heapmgr3.c, heapmgr4.c, and heapmgr5.c, with
tests RandomRandom and Worst, with call count 100000, and with maximum
chunk sizes 2000 and 20000? COPY THE OUTPUT OF THE TESTHEAP SCRIPT HERE.
You will lose points if you provide the data in any format that differs
from the output of the testheap script.
