the assignment? COPY THE LIST of authorized sources of information
given in the "Policies" web page to this section of the readme file,
and edit it as appropriate.

The course's lectures.

The course's precepts.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
What unauthorized sources of information did you use to complete the
assignment? List any unauthorized sources of information that you used
to complete the assignment, and describe how you used them. The course
"Policies" web page defines unauthorized sources of information, and
any source that you have used but not listed in the authorized sources
should be included here. Please note that using an unauthorized source
may trigger a course penalty, and depending on the nature of the
interaction, may additionally require the interaction being reported
to the Committee on Discipline. Write "None" if you used no
unauthorized sources of information.

None

What is your assessment of the assignment? Was it helpful? Was it fun?

I thought the assignment was pretty helpful for better understanding the
C programming language, especially usage of pointers and arrays. It was
average in terms of fun.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
(optional) What information can you provide about your submission that
will help your grader to grade it in the most favorable light? In
particular, what bugs are in your submission?

No known bugs.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
What warnings does splint generate on stra.c, and what are your
disagreements with them? Copy the splint warnings here, and express your
disagreement after each warning. If there are no warnings, then write
"None."

None.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
What warnings does critTer generate on stra.c, and what are your
disagreements with them? Copy the critTer warnings here, and express
your disagreement after each warning. If there are no warnings, then
write "None."

None.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
What warnings does splint generate on strp.c, and what are your
disagreements with them? Copy the splint warnings here, and express your
disagreement after each warning. If there are no warnings, then write
"None."

strp.c: (in function Str_search)
strp.c:118:17: Variable pHay used in inconsistent state
  An rvalue is used that may not be initialized to a value on some
  execution path. (Use -usedef to inhibit warning)
       strp.c:115:7: Storage pHay becomes inconsistent (released on one
       branch)

I have consulted the Splint Manual and attempted to edit my code many
times. I believe that splint is complaining about incrementing the char
pointer, but the only way to implement the function is by incrementing
the char pointer.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
What warnings does critTer generate on strp.c, and what are your
disagreements with them? Copy the critTer warnings here, and express
your disagreement after each warning. If there are no warnings, then
write "None."

None.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
What warnings does splint generate on replace.c, and what are your
disagreements with them? Copy the splint warnings here, and express your
disagreement after each warning. If there are no warnings, then write
"None."

None.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
What warnings does critTer generate on replace.c, and what are your
disagreements with them? Copy the critTer warnings here, and express
your disagreement after each warning. If there are no warnings, then
write "None."

None.

Is it possible for Str_copy or Str_concat to call assert to verify
that the destination memory area specified by the caller is large
enough? Explain.

No, it is not possible for Str_copy or Str_concat to call assert to
verify destination memory area in all cases. Intuitively, it seems
possible to verify destination memory by determining the length of the
destination string and comparing it with the length of the source
string. However, we get the length of a string by traversing the memory
address, which may lead us to attempt to access memory areas we cannot
access (i.e. segmentation fault). Thus, we may not always be able to
assert that the destination memory area is large enough to concatenate
or copy the source string.
